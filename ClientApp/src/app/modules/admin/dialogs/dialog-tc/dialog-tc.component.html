    <h2 style="font-weight: bold; font-size: large;">Introduction</h2>
    <p style="text-align: justify;" class="mt-4">This document describes the terms with which LOADGISTIX offers you access to our
        services. This agreement describes the terms and conditions applicable to your use of our available services.
        The User Agreement constitutes a legally binding agreement between you and LOADGISTIX. Please ensure that you
        read and understand these terms since you will be bound by it once a contract comes into effect by means of
        subscription. These terms and conditions govern your use of this website and by using this website, you
        therefore accept these terms and conditions in full. If you disagree with these terms and conditions or any part
        of these terms and conditions, please do not use this website.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;" class="mt-4">This website uses cookies. By using this website and agreeing to these terms and
        conditions, you consent to LOADGISTIX's use of cookies in accordance with the terms of LOADGISTIX's privacy and
        cookies policies. LOADGISTIX provides prequalification and validation upon both Customer and TSP registration
        but cannot guarantee validity of information and proof of documentation supplied by Customers and TSPs with
        respect to their licensure, insurance and registration. We do have an external vetting process linked, so we
        attempt to make every attempt to ensure that subscribers are certified service providers. As a result,
        LOADGISTIX is a Neutral Party and not a Transportation Service Provider (TSP), transport company, freight
        forwarder or broker. Our site acts as a portal where Customers and TSPs can meet and enter into agreements. We
        are not involved in the actual transaction between Customers and TSPs. We and our website function solely as a
        neutral venue and digital clearinghouse where two parties may agree on a price for a particular type of service.
        We are the neutral venue for this connection between you and other members. We do not provide any endorsement
        for you or your services, you acknowledge and agree that we do not provide the services and we are not in any
        way responsible for assisting you in any manner with your provision of the services. As a result, we have no
        control over the quality, safety, or legal aspects of the transactions that take place on our website. We cannot
        and will not guarantee the ability of members to complete payment for any of the provided services. Furthermore,
        due to the difficulty of individual authentication, especially on the Internet, we cannot and will not in any
        manner verify or confirm the identity or ability of members to pay for the provided services. You acknowledge
        and agree that any and all communications, correspondence, verbal or written, or any warranties or
        representations, made with regard to the services are not provided by us and are specifically and solely between
        you and the other member. Because we are not involved in the actual transaction between delivery customers and
        TSPs, we have no control over the accuracy of listings, the ability of TSPs to transport items, or the ability
        of delivery customers to send items. We cannot ensure that a delivery customer or TSP will actually complete a
        delivery.</p>
